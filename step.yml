        Specify the directory or file path which will be deployed.
        If the specified path is a directory then every file
        in the directory will be deployed - but only the
        files in the specified directory, sub-directories
        won't be uploaded. For uploading the directory's content
        recursively you should use the *Compress* option
        which will compress the whole directory, with
        every sub-directory included.

        If you specify a file path then only the specified
        file will be deployed.

        If this option is allowed the artifacts
        found in the *Deploy directory* folder will be compressed
        into a single file.

        You can specify a custom name for the ZIP using the *zip_name*
        option - otherwise we're going to use the *Deploy directory* name.

        If this option is turned off the artifacts
        found in the *Deploy directory* folder will be deployed
        separately.

        with others who are not registered on Bitrise.

        Your App's user roles to notify, comma separated.

        An example to notify your developers and testers:

        `testers, developers`

        If you want to notify everyone in the app's team just specify `everyone`.

        If you don't want to notify anyone set this to `none`.
